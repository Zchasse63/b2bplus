# Notion B2B+ Reorganization Plan

## Current Structure
- **B2B Plus** (main page)
  - Empty paragraph

## Problems
1. Everything is buried in one massive implementation guide
2. Hard to find specific information
3. Not clear what's completed vs. what's remaining
4. Based on original plan, not reflecting actual progress
5. No clear prioritization of remaining work
