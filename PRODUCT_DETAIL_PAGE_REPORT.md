## Technical Features

### Pricing Integration

The product detail page integrates with the existing centralized pricing engine:

```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/pricing/calculate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    organizationId,
    userId: user.id,
    items: [{
      productId: product.id,
      quantity,
      basePrice: product.base_price,
    }],
  }),
})
```

This ensures consistent pricing across the platform with support for:
- Price locks
- Contract prices
