# Notion Reorganization Guide: B2B+ Project

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Author:** Manus AI
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Implementation

---

## 1. Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive plan for reorganizing the B2B+ project in Notion. The current structure, with all information nested within a single implementation guide, is difficult to navigate and does not accurately reflect the project's progress. 

The proposed new structure will create a clear, organized, and up-to-date project management system that you can use as a single source of truth for the B2B+ project.

---

## 2. Proposed New Structure

The new structure will consist of a main dashboard page with several child pages, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the project.

### Main Page: **B2B Plus**

This will be the central hub for the project, providing a high-level overview and quick access to all other pages.

**Content to Add:**
