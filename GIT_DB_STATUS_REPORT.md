# Git & Supabase Database Status Report

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Review

---

## 1. Git Workflow & Branching Strategy

### Current Status
All recent development work, including the order management system, user profile pages, and the new product detail page, has been consolidated and committed to a new feature branch.

- **Branch Name:** `feature/web-mvp-complete`
- **Commit:** A single, comprehensive commit has been made containing all changes.

### Recommended Workflow
You should **not** push these changes directly to the `main` branch. Instead, follow a standard pull request (PR) workflow:

1.  **Push the Feature Branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/web-mvp-complete
    ```
2.  **Create a Pull Request:**
    On GitHub, create a new pull request from `feature/web-mvp-complete` to `main`.
3.  **Code Review:**
    This allows for a thorough review of all the new code, ensuring quality and preventing accidental bugs from reaching the main codebase.
4.  **Merge to Main:**
    Once the pull request is approved, it can be merged into the `main` branch.

This process ensures stability and provides a clear history of all changes made.

## 2. Supabase Database Schema Verification

### Schema Readiness
The Supabase database schema is **fully prepared** to support all the newly implemented frontend features, including the comprehensive product detail page. No immediate database changes are required.

### Key Verifications

#### **Products Table (`products`)**
The existing `products` table in the initial schema (`20240101000000_initial_schema.sql`) already contains all the necessary columns to support the detailed product view:

| Column Name | Data Type | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `additional_images` | `TEXT[]` | ✅ **Exists** |
| `specifications` | `JSONB` | ✅ **Exists** |
| `allergens` | `TEXT[]` | ✅ **Exists** |
| `nutritional_info` | `JSONB` | ✅ **Exists** |
| `dimensions_inches` | `JSONB` | ✅ **Exists** |
| `weight_lbs` | `DECIMAL(8,2)` | ✅ **Exists** |

#### **Categories Table (`categories`)**
- The `categories` table was created via the `20251031000000_create_categories_table.sql` migration.
- This migration also correctly adds the `category_id` foreign key to the `products` table, ensuring the relationship between products and categories is established.

### Migration Status
- **No New Migrations Needed:** All required schema changes are already captured in existing migration files.
- **Migration Cleanup:** The migration directory has been cleaned up to remove duplicate seed files.

The final set of relevant migrations is:
```
supabase/migrations/
├── 20240101000000_initial_schema.sql
├── 20240101000001_rls_policies.sql
├── 20251031000000_create_categories_table.sql
├── 20251031000001_seed_categories.sql
└── 99999999999999_seed_test_data.sql
```
